## Agenda and notes

- **Welcome any newcomers**
- **Announcements**
  - Introduction of David Murphy taking over from Alyssa, due to her leaving Broadcom.
- **What is the plan for core extensions? Will the core maintainers be responsible for those extensions and when are they coming out?**
  - Yes, the core maintainers will continue to maintain those extensions. They are not going to come out for the 3008 release. The core team first needs to set up the infrastructure to pull them out (such as testing, documentation, installation methods). The good news is that the necessary infrastructure is exactly what the community needs as well, so the core team can work together with the community to find good solutions.
- **Which process should people (be able to) follow to include a fresh extension (not a ported one) into the org?**
  - Shane has deprecated the core tool in favor of the superior copier tool,
- **Where are we in the process of module migration? Is anyone still actually working on porting modules? Also: How can we minimize friction in this process and most effectively prioritize work?**
  - David about to use copier to make core extension for Cassandra
- **Is there anything that can be done to ensure the organization stays healthy in the absence of Nick?**
  - Nick who unfortunately been missing in action for several months now, has Max and Jean-Luc co-maintainers
- **Should the `salt-extension` tool be retired in favor of the Copier template?**
  - Done, Shane took an action item to mention the need to deprecate the core tool in favor of the superior copier tool

- Discussion of next steps with this working group.

## Next steps

- Next meeting is September 5th.
