## Agenda and notes

- **Welcome any newcomers**
- Today's agenda is: We're making a change in working group leadership.
- Which process should people (be able to) follow to include a fresh extension (not a ported one) into the org?
- Where are we in the process of module migration? Is anyone still actually working on porting modules? Also: How can we minimize friction in this process and most effectively prioritize work? [TLDR: Automation mostly works fine from my experience with saltext-vault and saltext-pushover, awareness/documentation is lacking, possibly interest as well]
- Anything that can be done to ensure the organization stays healthy in the absence of Nick?
- Discussion of next steps with this working group.

## Next steps

- Next meeting is August 1.
